kgs_stats is a simple ruby script to get stats about your Go game scores.
I wanted to get stats about how I was doing every month so I made this script.

For now you can specify:
- the user you want to get stats from
- the size of the board for the games you want to get stats from
- the month you want to get stats from

TODO:
- get stats for several months
- be able to specify ranked or free games
- get stats for ranked versus free games
- get stats for all kinds of games
- stats visualization using ChartDirector

Feel free to improve it if you feel like it.
